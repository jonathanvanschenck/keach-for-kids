    notes: |-
      Substituting "all things" for "everything", [see note on Question 2](/cfyc/questions/2).
      Substituting "is hidden" for "can be hid" for more direct phrasing to emphasize God's knowledge rather than
      human's inability (c.f. Hebrews 4:13 ESV/NIV).

    notes: |-
      Substituting "all things" for "anything" [see note on question 2](/cfyc/questions/2).
      Additionally, we sharpen "can do" to "does" -- which is of more relevance. It is not
      merely that God is omnipotent (insofar as is consistent with His character),
      but that he *does*, in fact, enact His will. Finally, we drop "holy" so as to convert
      the noun phrase "his holy will" to a verb phrase "He wills", which seems to flow better.

      Word order is changed for clarity and "act for" is changed to "represent" for better

      "All mankind" is changed to "everyone" and "effect had ... on" is rearranged and simplified "is the result of".

      Sharpening the question by converting the past participle "called" into the present tense verb "call",

    notes: |-
      Sin is not the subject of "deserve", but the object, so the question is rephrased to include the (implicit) subject for clarity.
      Additionally, We retain the theologically significant terms "wrath" and "curse".

    scriptures:

      A: "No; our hearts must be changed before we can live with God."
    notes: |-
      The notion of "going to heaven" seems out of place given the surrounding context of
      the fall and original sin. More relevant than the place (heaven, or better the new Earth
      in the eternal Kingdom) is the fellow resident there (God). So we modify the question and
      answer to focus better on the central issue of alienation from God, rather than terminal
      location. This has the side benefit of bringing the issue of sin back into time -- sin doesn't
      just prevent us from heaven, but keeps God from dwelling with us *now*.

      As before, we reorder "we call" vs "called", and use "this" instead of "a" to more clearly

      A: "Only the Holy Spirit."
    notes: |-
      The answer is sharpened to "only the ..." instead of "... alone". Unlike previous questions,
      "The Holy Spirit alone" is not a specific theological phrase (c.f. "The bible alone") so
      the simpler construction is preferred.

      A: "It condemns everyone because everyone has broken it."
    notes: |-
      Change none to "no one" for consistency with previous question. Rather than two things,
      the "condemnation" is the primary issue with the "breaking" merely being the cause. So
      we reverse the ordering to bring the primary issue forward. Additionally, "all have broken"
      is not similar enough to a biblically significant phrase (like "all have sinned"), so
      the simpler/more direct "everyone has" is preferred.

      A: "To keep the whole law for His people, and to make atonement for their sins."
    notes: |-
      "Undertake" is simplied to "agree to do". "Agree" also has the added benefit of matching
      the definition given for covenant in [question 22](/cfyc/questions/22). Additionally, several
      questions later focuses on the particular category of penal subsitutionary atonement, so we
      adopt the technical language "make atonement" and allow the future question to clarify the
      meaning. C.f. questions [28](/cfyc/questions/28), [29](/cfyc/questions/29) and [30](/cfyc/questions/30).

    notes: |-
      This question has been reinterpreted as an explicit clarification of the first part
      of the answer to [question 45](/cfyc/questions/45), in that Christ does in fact do
      what he undertakes to do. We retain the flavor of the original question and answer by
      including "in everything" to capture the same emphasis of "ever ... the least", but
      simplify the treefold list (holy, harmless and undefiled) as the descriptors seems somewhat
      redundant, and the nuanced differences seem inappropriate for the young audience.

      Originally question 48, reordered for better flow of thought.
      As with previous questions, "What is meant by" is modernized. Additionally, this question
      is reinterpreted as clarifying the answer to [question](/cfyc/questions/45), and so
      "the Atonement" is modified to the particular phrase from the previous qusetion "make atonement for ... sins".

      Originally question 47, reordered for better flow of thought.
      This question is reinterpreted as answering an "objection" to [question 47](/cfyc/questions/47), as
      such the question adds the phrase "and die" to match "suffering and dying" from the previous question.
      Addtionally, the answer is a bit wordy, so the Lord's titles are omited, along with other small cleaning.

      See [question 45](/cfyc/questions/45) for adapting "undertake". Additionally, the answer
      is simplified from "for whom ... should die" to "... would die for." Modern audiences (and
      certainly children) don't care if your sentences end in prepositions.
