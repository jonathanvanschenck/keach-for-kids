# Keach's Catechism
A catechism based on the 1677 Baptist Confession (later the 1689 London Baptist Confession of Faith),
written by Benjamin Keach. This documument largely mirrors the Heidelburg and Westmister catechisms, with the primary
deviations being for Baptist particulars. This version follows the later (118 question) text and adapts the language into
modern English. Scriptural references are rendered in the English Standard Version.
