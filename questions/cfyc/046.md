# Question 46

---
## Modern Adaptation
**Question: Did our Lord Jesus Christ keep the whole of God's Law?**

*Answer: Yes; He was holy and blameless in everything.*

---
## Traditional Formulation
**Question: Did our Lord Jesus Christ ever commit the least sin?**

*Answer: No; he was holy, harmless, and undefiled.*

## Adaptation Commentary
This question has been reinterpreted as an explicit clarification of the first part
of the answer to [question 45](/cfyc/questions/45), in that Christ does in fact do
what he undertakes to do. We retain the flavor of the original question and answer by
including "in everything" to capture the same emphasis of "ever ... the least", but
simplify the treefold list (holy, harmless and undefiled) as the descriptors seems somewhat
redundant, and the nuanced differences seem inappropriate for the young audience.
