## Adaptation Commentary
"Undertake" is simplied to "agree to do". "Agree" also has the added benefit of matching
the definition given for covenant in [question 22](/cfyc/questions/22). Additionally, several
questions later focuses on the particular category of penal subsitutionary atonement, so we
adopt the technical language "make atonement" and allow the future question to clarify the
meaning. C.f. questions [28](/cfyc/questions/28), [29](/cfyc/questions/29) and [30](/cfyc/questions/30).
