## Adaptation Commentary
See [question 45](/cfyc/questions/50) for adapting "God's". Additionally, we simplify
"heart and conduct" to "thought and action". Regeneration is typically what is closely
connected with a "changed heart", so the simplifying of the word "heart" is not of
particular theological importance in this case.
