## Traditional Formulation
**Question: What does every sin deserve?**

*Answer: The wrath and curse of God.*

## Adaptation Commentary
Sin is not the subject of "deserve", but the object, so the question is rephrased to include the (implicit) subject for clarity.
Additionally, We retain the theologically significant terms "wrath" and "curse".
