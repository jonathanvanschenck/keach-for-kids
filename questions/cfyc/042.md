## Traditional Formulation
**Question: Why can none be saved through the covenant of works?**

*Answer: Because all have broken it, and are condemned by it*

## Adaptation Commentary
Change none to "no one" for consistency with previous question. Rather than two things,
the "condemnation" is the primary issue with the "breaking" merely being the cause. So
we reverse the ordering to bring the primary issue forward. Additionally, "all have broken"
is not similar enough to a biblically significant phrase (like "all have sinned"), so
the simpler/more direct "everyone has" is preferred.
