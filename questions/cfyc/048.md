## Adaptation Commentary
Originally question 47, reordered for better flow of thought.
This question is reinterpreted as answering an "objection" to [question 47](/cfyc/questions/47), as
such the question adds the phrase "and die" to match "suffering and dying" from the previous question.
Addtionally, the answer is a bit wordy, so the Lord's titles are omited, along with other small cleaning.
