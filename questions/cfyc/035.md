# Question 35

---

**Question: What is the result of Adam's sin for everyone?**

*Answer: Everyone is born in a state of sin and sadness.*

## Traditional Formulation
**Question: What effect had the sin of Adam on all mankind?**

*Answer: All mankind are born in a state of sin and misery.*

## Adaptation Commentary
"All mankind" is changed to "everyone" and "effect had ... on" is rearranged and simplified "is the result of".
Additionally, "misery" is changed to "sadness" for consistency with [question 33](/cfyc/questions/33).
