## Adaptation Commentary
The notion of "going to heaven" seems out of place given the surrounding context of
the fall and original sin. More relevant than the place (heaven, or better the new Earth
in the eternal Kingdom) is the fellow resident there (God). So we modify the question and
answer to focus better on the central issue of alienation from God, rather than terminal
location. This has the side benefit of bringing the issue of sin back into time -- sin doesn't
just prevent us from heaven, but keeps God from dwelling with us *now*.
