## Adaptation Commentary
Originally question 48, reordered for better flow of thought.
As with previous questions, "What is meant by" is modernized. Additionally, this question
is reinterpreted as clarifying the answer to [question](/cfyc/questions/45), and so
"the Atonement" is modified to the particular phrase from the previous qusetion "make atonement for ... sins".
