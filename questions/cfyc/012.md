# Question 12

---

**Question: Does God know everything?**

*Answer: Yes; nothing is hidden from God.*

---
## Traditional Formulation

## Adaptation Commentary
Substituting "all things" for "everything", [see note on Question 2](/cfyc/questions/2).
Substituting "is hidden" for "can be hid" for more direct phrasing to emphasize God's knowledge rather than
human's inability (c.f. Hebrews 4:13 ESV/NIV).
