# Question 40

---
## Modern Adaptation
**Question: Who can change a sinner’s heart?**

*Answer: Only the Holy Spirit.*

---
## Traditional Formulation
**Question: Who can change a sinner’s heart?**

*Answer: The Holy Spirit alone.*

## Adaptation Commentary
The answer is sharpened to "only the ..." instead of "... alone". Unlike previous questions,
"The Holy Spirit alone" is not a specific theological phrase (c.f. "The bible alone") so
the simpler construction is preferred.
