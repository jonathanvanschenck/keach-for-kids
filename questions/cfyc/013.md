## Adaptation Commentary
Substituting "all things" for "anything" [see note on question 2](/cfyc/questions/2).
Additionally, we sharpen "can do" to "does" -- which is of more relevance. It is not
merely that God is omnipotent (insofar as is consistent with His character),
but that he *does*, in fact, enact His will. Finally, we drop "holy" so as to convert
the noun phrase "his holy will" to a verb phrase "He wills", which seems to flow better.
