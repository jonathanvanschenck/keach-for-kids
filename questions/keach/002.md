## Adaptation Commentary
Here "a person" is substituted for "man", emphasizing the individual over the collective ("mankind") -- following the first-person subject of Psalm 73.
Additionally, "end" is simplified to "purpose" which loses the notion that humans are perfected into glorifying and enjoying overtime. However, the answer
embeds the notion of eternity ("forever"), helping to retain some of the idea of "end"/"telos".
