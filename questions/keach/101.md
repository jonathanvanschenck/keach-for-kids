> <sup>20</sup>But Peter said to him, “May your silver perish with you, because you thought you could obtain the gift of God with money!
> <sup>21</sup>You have neither part nor lot in this matter, for your heart is not right before God.

> <sup>23</sup>For I see that you are in the gall of bitterness and in the bond of iniquity.”

> <sup>33</sup>In his humiliation justice was denied him. Who can describe his generation? For his life is taken away from the earth.”
> <sup>34</sup>And the eunuch said to Philip, “About whom, I ask you, does the prophet say this, about himself or about someone else?”
> <sup>35</sup>Then Philip opened his mouth, and beginning with this Scripture he told him the good news about Jesus.
> <sup>36</sup>And as they were going along the road they came to some water, and the eunuch said, “See, here is water! What prevents me from being baptized?”
