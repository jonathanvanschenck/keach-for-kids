## Traditional Formulation
<strong>
    Question: How is the Sabbath to be sanctified?
</strong>

<em>
    Answer: The Sabbath is to sanctified by a holy resting all that day, even from such worldly employments and recreations as are lawful on other days, and spending the time in the public and private exercises of God's worship, except so much as is to be taken up in the works of necessity and mercy.
