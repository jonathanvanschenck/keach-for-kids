## Traditional Formulation
**Question: What is required to the worthy receiving of the Lord's Supper?**

*Answer: It is required of them that would worthily (that is, suitably) partake of the Lord's Supper, that they examine themselves, of their knowledge to discern the Lord's body; of their faith to feed upon Him; of their repentance, love, and new obedience: lest, coming unworthily, they eat and drink judgment to themselves.*
