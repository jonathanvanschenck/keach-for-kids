## Traditional Formulation
**Question: How do Baptism and the Lord's Supper become effectual means of salvation?**

*Answer: Baptism and the Lord's Supper become effectual means of salvation, not from any virtue in them or in him that administers them, but only by the blessing of Christ and the working of His Spirit in them that by faith receive them.*
