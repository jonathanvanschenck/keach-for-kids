# Question 98

## Question


## Answer


## Scriptural References
### 1 Peter 3:21 (ESV)
> <sup>21</sup>Baptism, which corresponds to this, now saves you, not as a removal of dirt from the body but as an appeal to God for a good conscience, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ,

### 1 Corinthians 3:6-7 (ESV)
> <sup>6</sup>I planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the growth.
> <sup>7</sup>So neither he who plants nor he who waters is anything, but only God who gives the growth.

### 1 Corinthians 12:13 (ESV)
> <sup>13</sup>For in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body—Jews or Greeks, slaves or free—and all were made to drink of one Spirit.

# Traditional Formulation
## Question
How do Baptism and the Lord's Supper become effectual means of salvation?

## Answer
Baptism and the Lord's Supper become effectual means of salvation, not from any virtue in them or in him that administers them, but only by the blessing of Christ and the working of His Spirit in them that by faith receive them.
