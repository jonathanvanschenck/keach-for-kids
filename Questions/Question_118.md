## Traditional Formulation
<strong>
    Question: What does the conclusion of the Lord's Prayer teach us?
</strong>

<em>
    Answer: The conclusion of the Lord's Prayer, which is, "For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, forever, Amen," teaches us to take our encouragement in prayer from God only, and in our prayers to praise Him, ascribing kingdom, power, and glory to Him; and in testimony of our desire, and assurance to be heard, we say, AMEN.
